This file implements the information given in the "Choosing Test Cases" section of Week 2.

Each function will have a table of test cases with three columns:
- The value of the argument(s) to the function.
- The expected return value of the function.
- A description of the test case.

An example for the vowels.count_vowels(s) function follows:

argument(s)	  Expected Value	Description

''	             0	            empty string
'a'	             1	            single char, vowel
'b'	             0	            single char, non-vowel
'pfffft'	     0	            several chars, no vowels
'bandit'	     2	            several chars, some vowels
'aeioua'  	     6	            several chars, all vowels*
* we included all 5 vowels to ensure each one is properly counted.


When choosing test cases, consider the following factors:
- Size
- Dichotomies
- Boundaries
- Order
